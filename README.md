# Description
The fiszki project has a beginning as a project for deepening knowledge about Spring Framework in a form that will not go to a drawer for forgetting. its goal its to create a learning place for those who want to use flip cards without having them carried everywhere.
In time I want this project to help people with learning all kinds of stuff related to programming. 
It is possible that this project will extend that to other fields of interest in the future.



## Goals for programmers:
- Deepening knowledge about Spring Framework
  - Boot
  - Security
  - JPA
  - Hibernate
  - Testing with JUnit

- Deepening knowledge about REST API

- Training PostgreSQL knowledge
  - Plan database
  - Implement DataBase
  - Write scripts to update remote DataBase

## Main application features for users:
  - Quick and easy to access learning place based on the flip-cards idea
  - Multiple categories that can be selected for learning
  - Users can check chosen cards as learned, and that card will not be shown while browsing
  - Users can add new Questions
  - Users can view a list of questions instead of drawing one
  
## Features that are in progress:
  - Answers can be voted for choosing the best answer
  - Users can edit/delete items created by them
  - Multiple category chan be chosen for browsing
  - User can set daily / weekly goals to learn a set of question or master a topic
  
### Plans:
  - Create an Android App that will consume this API
